# Hi there 👋 I'm Janine!

𖹭 I'm a sophomore Computer Science student at Cal Poly Pomona with a passion for analysis, problem-solving, and AI/ML. I love applying technical skills to real-world challenges where I can make a meaningful impact.

𖹭 I've built foundational AI/ML experience through the Break Through Tech AI program and participated in multimedia research and robotics workshops. My journey is driven by curiosity, creativity, and a commitment to equity in tech.

𖹭 As a proud advocate for underrepresented communities, especially women in STEM, I’m excited to help bridge the gap in opportunity and representation.
